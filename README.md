## What's this?

Creative Coding Playground is a page I am developing in my free time as a learning tool for the [Creative Coding with Canvas & WebGL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/canvas-webgl/) course by [Matt DesLauriers](https://github.com/mattdesl) on Frontend Masters.

## Spaghetti code warning!
This is a <b>work-in-progress proof of concept</b> and it's not meant, for now, to be a reference on any topic in any way - JS, React, canvas, project structure, etc.

## Demo

Check the demo at [https://danilorossi.github.io/creative-coding-playground/](https://danilorossi.github.io/creative-coding-playground/)

## Next steps
- Refactor renderer files as they are not currently structured and there is a lot of duplication (also useful for code showing purposes on the webpage)
- Delegate heavy computation to a WebWorker - using Context APIs most probably
- Add new examples for [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/)
- Fix canvas 'export to image' feature from the original [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) library, as the behavior is not correct in my application (probably due to canvas reuse across multiple sketches)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
